# Statistics Tables

This folder contains HTML versions of the tables for the statistics reference sheet. This is temporary content, for initial review, and will be deleted once the sheet is finalized.

## Tables Included

1. **Table A**: Standard Normal Probabilities
2. **Table B**: t-Distribution Critical Values
3. **Table C**: χ² (Chi-Square) Distribution Critical Values

## Usage

These tables are the raw unstyled table data for the statistics reference sheet. Please review these for data, image placement and accuracy of text, and organization. Don't worry about how they look. 

I maintained the repeating headers in the same locations as in print. There is probably a better way to do this; we can also add striping. 

## File Structure

- `ap-statistics-tables.html`: Contains the HTML representation of the statistical tables.
- `table-a.jpg`, `table-b.jpg`, `table-c.jpg`, `table-d.jpg`: Images referenced by the sheet

## How to View

To view the tables, open the `ap-statistics-tables.html` file in a web browser. The tables are formatted for easy reading and reference.
